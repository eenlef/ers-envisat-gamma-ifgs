Hello, so you want to make an interferogram using ERS (1991-2011) or Envisat (2002-2012) data, using Gamma software?
You're in the right place!

There are several steps involved with creating interferograms using Gamma, and it slightly depends on the output you desire. My motivation to create interferograms was to prepare a series of them for StaMPS (https://github.com/dbekaert/StaMPS). However, I started off by creating individual interferograms, which is an important place to start to understand how to make an ifg. 

The main difference with my looped scripts for StaMPS is that all SLCs were resampled to a "super-primary" SLC for the Small Baseline approach, and therefore I didn't need to do further resampling when creating the interferograms.

*** The basics on how to make an interferogram ***

Loosely described in most up to date version, GAMMA_makeifg_envisat.sh
Also in bin/GAMMA_resample_batch.sh and bin/GAMMA_makeifg_single.sh

This is a basic overview and there are many more whistles and bells you can add.
Note: ERS & Envisat have basically the same processing steps, once SLCs have been created. Their main difference is that they begin in different file formats.

1. Download SAR (SAR_IMS_1P) & orbital data from the ESA website in the desired format for specific track & frame:

	Collection: https://esar-ds.eo.esa.int/oads/access/collection

	ERS: https://esar-ds.eo.esa.int/oads/access/collection/SAR_IMS_1P

	Envisat: https://esar-ds.eo.esa.int/oads/access/collection/ASA_IMS_1P

	Orbital data: http://deos.tudelft.nl/ers/precorbs/orbits/

2. Define the primary and secondary dates for the interferograms, and if they are ERS-1 or 2. 
3. Extract data into slc and slc parameter files, and apply orbital parameters.
4. Generate best-fit offset and coregistration files between the primary and secondary SLC geometries.
5. Resample the secondary SLC to the primary geometry.
6. Caclulate interferogram from co-registered SLC image data.
7. Tidy up, by estimating interferometric and perpendicular baselines, curved Earth phase trend, and flat earth trend.
8. Complete the DEM correction (a wee bit complicated).
9. Adaptive interferogram filter using the power spectral density.
10. Convert interferogram from radar to map geometry.
11. Generate coherence files.
12. Unwrap interferogram in radar geometry, the convert to map geometry.

*** Making a series of interferograms for StaMPS ***

ERS Scripts used:

	GAMMA_resample_loop.sh - For loop to go through SLC for each date
	GAMMA_resample_single.sh
	GAMMA_makeifg_loop.sh - For loop to go through each interferogram
	GAMMA_makeifg_single.sh
	BASH_move2stamps.sh - script to move relevant files into folder format ready for StaMPS processing

Envisat Scripts used:
	
	GAMMA_1resample_loop_envisat.sh
	GAMMA_1resample_single_envisat.sh
	GAMMA_2makeifg_loop_envisat.sh
	GAMMA_2makeifg_single_envisat.sh

Folder format: feel free to edit/make more efficient or hardcode new folder locations.

	bin:				(all scripts)
 	data:
		input			(list of dates and interferograms)
		SAR			(SAR or ASAR files downloaded from ESA) # track & frame may also need to be defined
		SLC 			(files extracted from SAR)
		SLC_noorbits 		(files names edited before orbits applied) # arguably inefficient, removed for Envisat
		SLC_orbits		(files with orbits applied)
		topo			(topographic files for geocoding)

	output_rslc: 			(all useful resampled files, rslc rmli and parameter files)
	output_other:			(other files generated during resampling)
	output_ifg:			(files generated during interferogram creation)
	StaMPS:				(files ready to use in StaMPS)

Good luck!
